This is the metaclassifier introduced by Celis et al (2018). It's code implementation can be found here: https://aif360.readthedocs.io/en/stable/modules/generated/aif360.algorithms.inprocessing.MetaFairClassifier.html  

We modified compas_dataset.py and adult_dataset.py to find and load our datasets. Finally, we added law_school_dataset.py. Minor changes were made in the data_preproc_functions.py for our preprocessing needs. This preprocessing steps are necessary to use the MetaFairClassifier as implemented by AIF360. We redirect the reader to its example implementation here: https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/blob/master/examples/demo_meta_classifier.ipynb
